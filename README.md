# Path of Exile: Tujen Helper
A tool for Path of Exile 3.15 Expedition League to determine the artifact breakpoint for an item to be profitable.

Utilizes poe.ninja api to get current item prices and official Path of Exile api to get list of current leagues.

## How to use
**Useful Links**
- Getting POESESSID: https://cptpingu.github.io/poe-stash/poesessid.html
1) When program first opened, select whether you want to use the inbuilt webscraper or your POESESSID to get the latest leagues. Link to how to get it above. Otherwise, if you select POESESSID  and it was previously 
entered and valid, it will have been saved and automatically reused for this step. 
2) Select league of choice.
3) Make sure Path of Exile is selected. (Open the game and if it is already opened, select it to be in focus.)
4) Press ```control+c``` when hovered over an item in Tujen's store to get item value in artifact.

**Hotkeys**
- ```control+c``` - Get item value in artifacts
- ```shift+control+o``` - Toggle always-on-top (currently program must be selected, have to find unused hotkey)
